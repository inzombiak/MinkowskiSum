# MinkowskiSum
Minkowski Sum/Difference calculator. Ended up also implementing ear clipping for concave polygons.
The ear clipping is done in the "CreateConcaveShape" function.
I ended up spending more time on the ear clipping for concave polygons than I did on the Minkowski.

Note: Theres no testing for non-simple polygosn yet, so keep it ordered please.

Requirements:
SFML for rendering.
